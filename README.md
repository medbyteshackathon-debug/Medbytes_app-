Description: 
Our software solution is designed specifically for pregnant women in these areas This app created allows pregnant women or anyone else to log in their current trimester, symptoms, illnesses and other medical conditions and  utilises a local network -  without any Wi-Fi connectivity – to transmit this information to nearby first responders and mobile, makeshift hospitals . This solution is versatile and practical  because doctors and first responders can immediately view their medical history and prioritise women in dire need of evacuation, based on their condition. The data collected serves a secondary purpose as well, which is providing doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals with medical history, allowing women personalized treatment after evacuation, if need be. This is crucial because medical camps infirmaries are normally packed in crisis areas, so this would cut down the time taken for doctors to examine pregnant patients for their medical history, hence cutting waiting times for other patients.
